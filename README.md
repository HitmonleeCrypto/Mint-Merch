  <b>Mint Merch Whitepaper:</b>
</div>

Mint Merch was founded as a community project with a goal to get merch into the hands of crypto enthusiasts and do our part in onboarding the first 1 Billion crypto users on chain. As a seed contribution in the Summer 2024 Bonkathon we are utilizing our team knowledge and experience to bring this idea to life. Merch is much more than just a piece of clothing, it can be a conversation starter, a feeling of meaning, or even a keepsake.


<div align="center">
  <b>Why Mint Merch?:</b>
</div>

Teams are already making incredible strides in developing their communities and advancing their projects, but imagine having a seamless solution to outsource merch creation. This way, you can concentrate on what truly matters while providing your community with even more reasons to rally behind you.

<div align="center">
  <b>What Makes Mint Merch Different:</b>
</div>

All merch from Mint Merch is of the highest quality possible. We focus on using embroidered merchandise wherever possible so that the items have a high value, long-lasting feel. Our team has been involved in the crypto space since 2017, so we understand the nature of crypto, crypto culture, and the natural waves of the market cycles.

Our goal with Mint Merch is to provide top-notch merchandise to passionate community members and builders, while making meaningful and consistent contributions to each token that partners with us. Additionally, we reinvest 55% of all profits back into the communities we collaborate with. Let’s discuss how…

<div align="center">
  <b>How We Give Back:</b>
</div>

After covering the costs of designs, merchandise, and fulfillment to customers, we use the remaining profit to build a sustainable business while making strong and consistent contributions to each of the unique communities that partner with Mint Merch. 

<div align="center">
  <b>Here’s how we split the profits:</b>
</div>

<br>

__10% = Burning Bonk Supply / Bonk Raffles:__

For supporting Mint Merch in the Bonkathon we will be using 10% of our profits to buy BONK tokens and either burn them or raffle them out to the Mint Merch Community on a weekly basis. 

__25% = Community Contributions:__

We will be contributing 25% of all profits to buying and burning (or raffling) the token of each community that we partner with. The amount that will be allocated to each respective community is based on their total share of sales within that period. 
Example: If Brand A has 20% of Sales, and there are $1,000 in Community Funds Available, then Brand A gets $200 toward token purchasing and burning or raffling out the token to the community in the style that the token team chose. 
If raffling is chosen, then each token team can choose the raffle style that best benefits them and their community. They have four options:
1. Raffle off the tokens to the entire Mint Merch community for growth.
2. Raffle them within their own community to support their loyal holders.
3. Raffle them off to wallets that purchased their merch in a period of time.
4. Use share of funds to purchase Mint Merch gift cards and raffle them to their chosen community to support merch purchases. These gift cards will be exclusive for their community items.

__20% = Marketing and Raffles:__

What's more exciting than getting something for free? With these funds, we will be raffling off exclusive merch, Mint Merch gift cards, hefty discount codes, and more!
This will be done via Twitter/X raffles to drive more visibility and engagement for each team. 
Additionally, these funds will fuel our marketing efforts to promote Mint Merch and attract a growing community of crypto enthusiasts and their unique teams!

__45% = Mint Merch Team:__

We focus on sustainability while delivering an outstanding customer experience and enriching our wonderful communities. By managing our profit split strategically, we can grow proportionally with the business, allowing us to continuously thrive and offer even more to our customers and communities.

<div align="center">
  <b>How The Ordering Process Will Work:</b>
</div>

**Locating the Mint Merch Store:**

Crypto fans will visit MintMerch.co, where they can select merch in their favorite style from their favorite crypto community.
If the token is not available, they can reach out to us, and we can contact the team to brainstorm some ideas together. 
Once the customer has found all necessary items, they will proceed to checkout.

  <b><s>Fiat?❌</s> Solana Pay✅</b>

To help onboard the first billion crypto users, we will utilize Solana Pay to accept prominent tokens like BONK, SOL, USDC, and other SPL or Token22 tokens.
For all users who pay with BONK, we will send 5% of the purchase back to the wallet they paid with (excluding tax).
One of the great features of using Solana Pay is that we will have transaction history on all customers' wallets that purchased each respective community’s merch. This information can be used for various purposes, such as rewards, potential airdrops, and more. This is yet another way for each community to show their dedication to their crypto passions.

<div align="center">
  <b>Order Fulfillment:</b>
</div>

<br>

  <b>Merchandise Creation:</b>

As we launch our business, we will leverage Printful's in-house embroidery and print-on-demand services (valued at over $1B) to ensure each piece of merch meets the highest quality standards. By using Printful, we can provide quick fulfillment and consistent product quality.

In the future, we plan to invest in our own embroidery machines and/or collaborate with local print shops to not only speed up our processes and improve business margins but also enhance customer satisfaction by ensuring faster delivery and more personalized service, enabling us to contribute more to each community!

  <b>Shipping to US Customers:</b>

Mint Merch is based in Southern California, USA. Your product is custom-made when you order, so it might take a bit longer to deliver. This helps us reduce overproduction. Thank you for making thoughtful purchasing decisions! Orders to the USA can be completed from the time of order to delivery in 5 to 11 business days.

  <b>Shipping to International Customers:</b>

No worries, we ship internationally too! Your product is custom-made when you order, so it might take a bit longer to deliver. This helps us reduce overproduction. Thank you for making thoughtful purchasing decisions! Orders to Europe can be completed from the time of order to delivery in 8 to 15 business days, and other regions in 12 to 24 business days.

<div align="center">
  <b>Customer Service:</b>
</div>

<br>

  <b>Customer Solutions:</b>

The Mint Merch team will be here to resolve any issues or questions about crypto merch received from our customers.
During the presale, we will also be the first line of support when customers inquire about which piece of merch may be best for them or discovering designs that may not be available in the store at the moment. Our goal is to be a positive addition to each community that partners with Mint Merch!

  <b>Partnering with Mint Merch:</b>

When teams partner with Mint Merch, we will utilize designs pre-created by their respective communities to craft their merch. We will collaborate with each team to ensure the merch meets their standards and aligns with the brand they are building.
Additionally, we can order samples, model them locally, sell them at events, and create high-quality digital content for social media and project engagement.

<div align="center">
  <b>Low-Hanging Fruit for Future Growth:</b>
</div>

<br>

<b>More Marketplaces:</b>

Our team has nearly a decade of e-commerce experience, which we can leverage to get more eyes on our designs across established marketplaces like IG Shop, FB Shop, TikTok Shop, Amazon, Walmart, and more.
By expanding our opportunities, we can increase visibility for each brand, leading to community growth and generous, consistent contributions for us!

  <b>Attending Live Events:</b>

Live crypto events are fantastic places to engage with the community and allow them to get their hands on merch from their favorite crypto communities!
By attending events like Consensus, Breakpoint, Permissionless, EthDenver, and other crypto-focused events, we can bring more exposure to each of the projects we sell merch for while networking with teams to expand our Mint Merch product offerings.

  <b>Interesting Future Ideas to Explore:</b>
</div>

<br>

<b>Soul-bound Merch NFTs:</b>

Inspired by the Solana Saga soul-bound NFT that came with each Solana Saga phone, we would automate the sending of cNFT's to each customer who checks out using Solana Pay and purchases merch from the respective community. 
The goal is to commemorate their unique purchase forever, rewarding them with OG status, potential rewards, potential airdrops, and more.

<b>Verified Merch NFTs:</b>

This would ideally apply to low-quantity, high-demand merch items. 
When a customer purchases a merch item from Mint Merch, they will be airdropped a cNFT “ticket” to redeem for the item purchased and then have two options:
1. Redeem the item by burning the cNFT or sending the cNFT to us and order the item from our website. We will confirm the transaction and ownership of the cNFT when they check out with the same wallet used for the transaction. 
2. Hold the merch cNFT to either HODL for a future time or sell it on a secondary market like Tensor/Magic Eden. We would share royalties profits with respective communities as explained prior. 
The benefit with this process is verified merchandise authenticity, ensuring all parties work with trustworthy clients.
